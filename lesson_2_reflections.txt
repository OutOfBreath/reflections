What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

- It creates the .git folder and sets up the files nessesary to use the Git versioning system
- You need to do it as above.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

- The staging area is a place where you can play with the files without actually doing anything with them
- It shows you the changes you are about to make before you make them - so reduces mistakes
